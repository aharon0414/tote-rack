## One-Time Setup: GitHub + Vercel

Do this once. After that, updates go live in under a minute.

### 1. Push to GitHub

```bash
# In the tote-rack folder:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "tote rack builder - initial"
```

Go to **github.com** → New Repository → name it `tote-rack` → create it, then run the two lines GitHub shows you:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURNAME/tote-rack.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to **vercel.com** → Add New Project
2. Click **Import** next to your `tote-rack` repo
3. Vercel auto-detects React — click **Deploy**
4. ~60 seconds later you have a permanent URL like `https://tote-rack.vercel.app`

From now on, every `git push` auto-deploys to that URL instantly.

---

## Install on iPhone (PWA)

1. Open your Vercel URL in **Safari** (must be Safari, not Chrome)
2. Tap the **Share** button (box with arrow)
3. Tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
4. Tap **Add**

The app opens full-screen with no browser chrome and **works offline** — perfect for the lumber yard or job site.

---

## Install on Desktop (PWA)

In Chrome or Edge, visit your Vercel URL and look for the install icon (⊕) in the address bar. Click it → Install. It opens as a standalone window.

---

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm start
# Opens at http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Making Changes with Claude Code

```bash
# Open Claude Code in the project folder:
claude

# Describe what you want changed. Claude edits files directly.
# When done, push to deploy:

git add .
git commit -m "describe your change"
git push
```

Vercel picks up the push automatically. Your phone and computer update the next time the app is opened with an internet connection.

## Rack Geometry Notes

- **Runners** run front-to-back (depth-wise), one pair per bay per row
- **Tote lids** rest on top of the runners — totes hang from their lids
- **2" headspace** above each tote (GAP_HEAD) for easy removal
- **3/16" side clearance** per side (GAP_SIDE) → bay width = 20.625"
- **1/8" front/back clearance** (GAP_FRONT / GAP_BACK) → runner length = 30.5"
